First of all, make a div of class "nav", which defines our navbar of our web page, In CSS part inside ".nav" selector i gave that width of 100% and padding 2%, and also given the background of that navbar, a gradient effect by the help of linear-gradient property\
then again in HTML part, we make another nested div of class button and sub-element, as shown below image\

But something wrong with our navbar's elements, so lets adjust its positioning ,sizing, etc in CSS part
so i created ".button" and ".sub-element" selectors and set its "display" property at "inline-block"\
“display: inline-block” Property: This property is used to display an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but it can apply height and width values. It is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content). It looks like an inline element but it behaves as a block element and doesn’t force to line break. It allows having a block-level appearance while still being laid out inline with other elements.\
now our next propert is out margin-inline property\
"The margin-inline" property specifies the margin at the start and end in the inline direction\
now i want to change the color of the text of "sub-element" class texts
so set the color property inside ".sub-element" at white\
now our sub-elements are set, but our "button" still not looks good\
so inside ".button" selector add "color" property at "balck" to give color to our text, "background-color" property at "white" to make its background white, and last "padding" to set button size accurately\

now come to second part of our web page\
Make another div below our "nav" with class "main"\
In CSS part inside ".main" selector give background image for this div by using "background-image" property;
set "width" of the "main" div to 100%, "height" 500px and set "backgroung-repeat" property at "no-repeat" so our image will not repeat and in last "background-size" propety to "cover" so it will cover our whole width of div\

Lets Come to our 3rd part of the Web Page\
make another "div" OF class "main-2" and inside it give three images buy using "img" tag, each images have class "card"\
now come to CSS part:\
first set size of our "main-2" by giving height and width property to it\
now to set our images make a ".card" selector and inside it give proper height and width to the images as required and we ca see margin outside every images in all directions, so set set "margin" properly\
Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.\

in the last We have our footer of the web page\
so create Another "div" below the "main-2" class and give its class name "footer"\
inside this div we have two elemnts\
paragraph: so make a paragraph using "p" tage and give its class "foot-text"\
image: add a image to the footer by using "a" tag and give its class as "foot-image"\
Now come to CSS part of the Footer\
".footer" selector:\
this helps us to set size of the footer box, set "height" and "width" property of the footer and then give "background-color" property back color, and we can see some padding effect inside the footer so set "padding" property 2% \
The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border\
".foot-text" selector: \
set the "display" property at "inline-block" so our paragraph align in same line with the image\
now set the "width" property to 45% so our "p" tag tahes only 45% space inside the footer box\
make color of the text white bt setting "color" property to white\
".foot-image" selector: \
set the "display" property at "inline-block" so our image align in same line with the text\
now set the size of the image by giving "width" property 45%\
and margin set to ythe 1% \
